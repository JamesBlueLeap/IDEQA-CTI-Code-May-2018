# IDEQA-CTI-Code-May-2018
History Our customer (Curtin) had paid money to a 3rd party and wanted to “use it up” so got the 3rd party (IDEQA) to modify our code with some enhancements (instead of us). Idea is they give the modified code back to us and then we do all the changes from there. They have been at it for 4 weeks and the code has just come back.
